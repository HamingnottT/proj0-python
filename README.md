# proj0-python
Revature Big Data Project 0 - Python version

# Project Description
Project Requirements: Translate your project 0 or project 1 from Scala to Python.

This version of my project 0 is an improved version of my first creation, and utilizes Python's standard library, as well as the Python OS module for file manipulation. Application usernames and passwords are stored in a database separate from the website credentials database. This program has admin and user level access with different features for each. My goal was to create a user friendly application backed by a relational database management system to store and recall custom user credentials for a given website.

# Technologies Used
-VS Code v. 1.65.2

-Python v. 3.10.3

-MySQL v. 8.0

# Features
-Interactive CLI

-Database to store records on an admin and user level

-Database creation tool to get started

# Getting Started
Repo can be cloned easily using the Github CLI, Desktop app, or by using VS Code's Github integration. This project's source code should work well in any IDE as is has no IDE-specific dependencies. 

Requires an installation of MySQL 8.0 to connect to MySQL database. The scope of this project is limited to local, so no server connection is necessary. 
    Under the MySQL Resources folder, follow along with the DB Creation code to get started. 
    On startup, the application will ask for you to input your MySQL credentials to establish a connection with your local system.
    Included requirements.txt and a batch file for easy pip installation for windows users.

# Usage
Using the project will require creating/changing the default database used as it depends on MySQL 8.0 for storing username/passwords.  More features will be added later on for better versatility.
